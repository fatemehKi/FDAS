Practice:

1. An FBI survey shows that about 80% of all property crimes go unsolved. Suppose that in your town 3 such crimes are committed and they are each deemed independent of each other.

What is the probability that a) 1 of  the three of these crimes will be solved and b) that at least one of the crimes will be solved?

What is the expected number of crimes that remain unsolved and the standard deviation? 



2. Hospital records show that of patients suffering from a certain disease, 75% die of it. What is the probability that of 6 randomly selected patients, 4 will recover?


3. A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that on the average, 12% of his pistons are rejected because they are either oversize or undersize. What is the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain
no more than 2 rejects?
